Data sources Medline and Embase until June 2013.
Eligibility criteria for study selection Studies describing the development or external validation of a multivariable model for predicting CVD risk in the general population.
Results 9965 references were screened, of which 212 articles were included in the review, describing the development of 363 prediction models and 473 external validations. Most models were developed in Europe (n=167, 46\%), predicted risk of fatal or non-fatal coronary heart disease (n=118, 33\%) over a 10 year period (n=209, 58\%). The most common predictors were smoking (n=325, 90\%) and age (n=321, 88\%), and most models were sex specific (n=250, 69\%). Substantial heterogeneity in predictor and outcome definitions was observed between models, and important clinical and methodological information were often missing. The prediction horizon was not specified for 49 models (13\%), and for 92 (25\%) crucial information was missing to enable the model to be used for individual risk prediction. Only 132 developed models (36\%) were externally validated and only 70 (19\%) by independent investigators. Model performance was heterogeneous and measures such as discrimination and calibration were reported for only 65\% and 58\% of the external validations, respectively.
Conclusions There is an excess of models predicting incident CVD in the general population. The usefulness of most of the models remains unclear owing to methodological shortcomings, incomplete presentation, and lack of external validation and model impact studies. Rather than developing yet another similar CVD risk prediction model, in this era of large datasets, future research should focus on externally validating and comparing head-to-head promising CVD risk models that already exist, on tailoring or even combining these models to local settings, and investigating whether these models can be extended by addition of new predictors.},

\#\#\#\# Summary points

Risk prediction models that typically use a number of predictors based on patient characteristics to predict health outcomes are a cornerstone of modern clinical medicine.1 Models developed using data with few events compared with the number of predictors often underperform when applied to new patient cohorts.2 A key statistical reason for this is “model overfitting.” Overfitted models tend to underestimate the probability of an event in low risk patients and overestimate it in high risk patients, which could affect clinical decision making. In this paper, we discuss the potential of penalised regression methods to alleviate this problem and thus develop more accurate prediction models.

Statistical models are often used to predict the probability that an individual with a given set of risk factors will experience a health outcome, usually termed an “event.” These risk prediction models can help in clinical decision making and help patients make an informed choice regarding their treatment.3 4 5 6 Risk models are developed using several risk factors typically based on patient characteristics that are thought to be associated with the health event of interest (box …},

	abstract = {Background
We present a method utilizing Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) dataset for predicting disease risk of individuals based on their medical diagnosis history. The presented methodology may be incorporated in a variety of applications such as risk management, tailored health communication and decision support systems in healthcare.

Methods
We employed the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) data, which is publicly available through Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP), to train random forest classifiers for disease prediction. Since the HCUP data is highly imbalanced, we employed an ensemble learning approach based on repeated random sub-sampling. This technique divides the training data into multiple sub-samples, while ensuring that each sub-sample is fully balanced. We compared the performance of support vector machine (SVM), bagging, boosting and RF to predict the risk of eight chronic diseases.

Results
We predicted eight disease categories. Overall, the RF ensemble learning method outperformed SVM, bagging and boosting in terms of the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC). In addition, RF has the advantage of computing the importance of each variable in the classification process.

Conclusions
In combining repeated random sub-sampling with RF, we were able to overcome the class imbalance problem and achieve promising results. Using the national HCUP data set, we predicted eight disease categories with an average AUC of 88.79\%.},
